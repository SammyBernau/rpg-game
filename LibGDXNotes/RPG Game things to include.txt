RPG Game things to include

- use dependency injection (guice library by google)
- traits (interfaces in java), abstracts
- scalable (Single player game can be easily turned into multiplayer)
- cloud save?


GameDataSaver trait 
- could make it a trait for specific intances of what is being saved (local play vs online play)
	- JsonDataSaver (local)
	- DatabaseDataSaver (online)


Enemy Class and bind it to a json enemy or a database enemy (which are the classes)

Create a wrapper class that is saved as one thing into a json file (can be done better using injection)

module and composition not inheritance
