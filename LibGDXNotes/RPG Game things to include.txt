RPG Game things to include

- use dependency injection (guice library by google)
- traits (interfaces in java), abstracts
- scalable (Single player game can be easily turned into multiplayer)
- cloud save?


GameDataSaver trait 
- could make it a trait for specific instances of what is being saved (local play vs online play)
	- JsonDataSaver (local)
	- DatabaseDataSaver (online)


Enemy Class and bind it to a json enemy or a database enemy (which are the classes)

Create a wrapper class that is saved as one thing into a json file (can be done better using injection)

module and composition not inheritance



use inheritance to create entity structure and use entity 'provider' to handle
    - supply the provider the input for creating entity
    - using a provider = functional (basically an underlining factory)
    - factory is a class that creates stuff
    - provider gives us the factory class (doesnt take any arguements)
        - use a provider when you want state for an object
        - factory may have mutable state that wants to be changed for every new instance of it created
    
TODO ITEMS
Look up how to design a tick rate
    - updates entities
    - essentially a big running thread that updates every so often and in between ticks do calculations
    - based on time elapsed versus or use delta time given by libGDX
    
    
    
TODO -> THINK ABOUT WHAT DATA ROUTE I WANT
    - Just DataAccess
    - DataAccessFactory
