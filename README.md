# RPG-Game

## What is this project?
The purpose of this project is to create a 2D classic style RPG game inspired by games like Old School Runescape, World of Warcraft and Diablo. It is also meant to serve as a way to gain experience in both game development and programming with Scala.

## Libraries/Frameworks
Here is a list of the tools I am actively using in the project
1. Scala (main language for both the frontend and backend)
2. SBT (dependency manager)
3. libGDX (game development framework used for the game itself and its UI elements https://libgdx.com/)
4. Guice (dependency injection for modularity of code)



## Current Plans
### Short term:
Create a single player experience that allows the player to...
1. Create a character
2. Select desired save file
3. Enter manually created world 
4. Complete objectives such as quests and monsters bounties originating from one hub (the tavern)
5. Save game and exit

### Long term: 
Implements the same elements of the short term goal but extends game to include multiplayer support


### Game state
Notes regarding the current state of the game and notes about systems being used/planned to be included are further detailed in 'Notes.txt' under the 'projectnotes' directory.
